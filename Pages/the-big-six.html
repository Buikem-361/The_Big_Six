        <p>This football club has won the prem 20 times
             with the most recent being under their new manager
            Arne Slot. They have also enjoyed thier most recent
             European glory in 2020 under Jurgen Klopp when they 
             lifted club football's 2nd biggest trophy in the UEFA 
             Champions League. The club and its manager Arne Slot 
            are under a little bit of pressure due to thier most 
        recent dip in form with the likes of Mo Salah and Florian Wirtz
    failing to live up to the fan's expectations.</p>

    <img src="./design.html/logos/image 2.webp" width="900px">
    <br>
      
        <p>This club popularly known England's biggest has failed to live 
            up to the name. Sturggled to find consistency under the likes
            of Ralf Ragnick, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunner Solkgear,
            Erik Ten Hag with the most recent of them being Ruben Amorim.
            But nevertheless, this club has gone out of their way to acquire 
            big money signings in the last summer transfer window
            in the likes of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbenmo, Matteus Cunha alongside
             many others.

        <br>

        <p>The BLUES and current WORLD CHAMPIONS as fondly known by fans have enjoyed
            a huge amount of success in very recent years at a long spell of bad
             result under new owner, Todd Boehly. With the appointment of Clearlake
             as new sporting director, the club has shifted it focus to investing
                in young, unproven players with the likes of Estavao, Quenda,
            Gittens, Garnacho George all being introduced to first team activities
                 at the club despite all of them being below 21. </p>

    <li><h3>Arsenal</h3></li>
    <img src="./design.html/logos/image 4.webp" width="900px">
    <br>

        <p>This club from north london has accumulated the most points across the last 
            three seasons without lifting the all important league trophy which
        the fans  crave. Having come close 3 seasons in a row and falling short thrice,
    the fans, the players, the staff, the management and the club at large hope they have
    what it takes to go all the way this year with the defensive unit of the team looking
    like the engine powering the squad at the moment. </p>

    <br>
       <p>I think we all would agree that a point over the last 10 years the English
        title  became very out of reach due to the dominace displayed by this monsterous
         football club. Managed by the spaniard Pep Guadiola, the citzens went 4 years 
        as the undisputed champions of the league which thanks and credits to the likes
        of Erling Haaland, Kevin de Brunye, Ruben Dias and of course, the Ballon D'or
        Winner, Rodri. This club would aim at regaining the league title regardless of the 
    strong competition from the reds of London and Merseyside</p>

    <li><h3>Tottenham Hotspurs</h3></li>
    <img src="./design.html/logos/image 6.webp" width="900px">
    <br> 
               <p>Arguably the smallest of the English heavy weights, the hotspurs have ended
             a 17 year wait for a trophy of any kind with the help of the Australian, Ange 
            Postecoglou who was dismissed 17 days after winning the trophy for ending
            17th in the English top flight. Now under Thomas Frank, the team is built on 
            defensive solidity rather than the all attack philosophy that Ange believed in. 
            Currently 6th in the league, they are beautifully poised to challenge for a place 
            in the Champions League if they keep up the momentum.</p>
